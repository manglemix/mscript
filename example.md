# EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE IN WINTER BLANKETED WITH SNOW. DAY
We look at the whole house straight on. The front door should be in frame, but it is not the focus. Other houses are not quite in view, but the setting should clearly be covered in snow.

## Henry
I think I just happened to sit next to him during lunch. While everyone was already eating, he was just staring at his lunch box. I was curious, but I was too shy to say anything so I just stared at him.

JACK stares back at HENRY, then turns back at his lunch box. JACK then depressingly opens his lunch box.

## Henry
It turns out he didn't have any food to eat! My reflexes kicked in and I gave him half of my sandwich no questions asked.
